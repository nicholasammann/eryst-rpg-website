# Laws of Magic

## Spell Fatigue

You can attempt to cast a spell that requires more magical energy than you currently possess. There is a significant chance that you will fail to cast the spell.

For every X points of magical energy the spell requires that you do not possess, there is X percent chance of failure. 
Roll a d100 to determine if you succeed or fail to cast the spell. 

Regardless of the outcome (succeed/fail to cast the spell), you gain 1 rank of Spell Fatigue. 

If you failed to cast the spell, roll a d100 again with the same X percent chance of failure. If you fail this roll, your current Spell Fatigue status (including the rank gained from this attempt) becomes Permanent Spell Fatigue of the same rank.
