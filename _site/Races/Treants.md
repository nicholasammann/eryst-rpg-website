The treants abandoned Eryst when the conflict on the continent became less prevalent, after the end of the First Era.

Around that time, the balance of the Faerie Realm and the Abyssal Realm had shifted in favor of the demons. The treants migrated to the Faerie Realm to defend the trees in that realm that were being destroyed in the war between faerie and demons. The reason for the exodus of the treants is not known by most of the continent.

Only a select few in Ardella and Estilia have a connection to the Faerie Realm and have some knowledge of what is happening there.
