Covered in thick forest that has been cultivated for hundreds of years, Ardella is the stronghold of the wood elves of Eryst. The wood elves of Ardella act as sentinels and guardians of the forest, keeping the realm safe for the beasts and fey creatures that live there. Ardella is free of evil creatures, but home to many proud and fierce beasts that demand the respect of residents and travelers alike. Wood elves prefer to live in harmony with the forest, reflected in the natural construction of their towns and cities. Ardellan settlements are grown from the living wood, often shrouded in glamours and illusions that make them impossible for unwanted travelers to find. Ardella is ruled by a council of elders, druids and veteran rangers. Each group makes up one third of the council. The elders primarily represent the interests of the people, the druids speak for the well-being of the forest, and the rangers ensure the safety of the realm against outside forces (mainly Orcish raiding parties from Gantrik and human bandits from Fallona and Hallangar). Treants used to roam the forest of Ardella before the Second Era, but their numbers diminished as the realm became more peaceful. No treants have been seen in the continent since the year 400 of the Second Era. The forests of Ardella are self-sufficient and mostly closed to outside travel, but halflings from Birschland are held in good standing due to their love of peace and farming. High elves from Estilia occasionally travel to Ardella to visit their woodland relatives, or stay there while on their way to Hvammsund. ",

Before the First Era, when deities could interact more directly with the material plane, the deity Amrott sculpted the land of Arlesh into a home for the fire giants, who have long worshipped him with great fervor. Their culture is dedicated to crafting and each fire giant chooses a craft upon reaching adulthood. Due to their affinity with fire, heat is incorporated into crafting for most fire giants. Metalworking and glassblowing are popular choices, but fire giants find a way to incorporate heat into woodworking, stonework, and many other crafts. So Amrott raised three volcanoes across the land of Arlesh, made the caverns beneath the stone plains rich with all types of metal ore, created great trees to match the size of his followers, and made great mountains of flawless stone of all varieties. Blessed with an abundance of natural resources and raw magma to fuel their massive forges, the fire giants built truly remarkable cities of stone and metal that surpass even the dwarven cities of the continent. Isolated from the conflict of the continent, with only the tumultuous land of Berski to the north posing no threat, fire giants have been able to focus solely on their crafts for centuries. ",

It possesses neither the trade wealth of nearby Vitchar, nor the noble lineage and knightly orders of its sister kingdom, Hallangar. A primarily human land, most Dufastanians are farmers, shepherds, or simple crafters. Dufastanians are generally resigned to their position in life and frown upon those who stir up trouble or propose new ideas. Although the culture is industrious and values construction and craft, the people dislike ingenuity or creativity. Those who have a hard time following laws often leave for the thriving ports of Vitchar, where any able-bodied commonfolk can find work as a sailor or at one of the merchant companies. A common person bored with a simple life can pursue a more adventurous career as a soldier in one of the numerous mercenary companies throughout Dufastan. These mercenary companies provide training, housing, and pay for those who agree to serve for a minimum of 4 years. They operate mainly in Hallangar fighting against the Orcs of Gantrik and the various evil peoples of Tierre. Companies that aren’t able to secure a contract with Hallangar may hire out to powerful Vitcharian merchants to act as household or caravan guards, or rarely to the dwarven kingdom of Kursk to aid in their fight against the southern Kyrgann goblins. While Dufastan does not share borders with Gantrik or Tierre, raiding parties from both regions periodically cross into Dufastan when old hunting grounds become stale. Most mercenary companies are responsible for the lands that surround their training grounds, so it falls to those companies to protect the villages on their lands from bandits and raiders. The more honorable and prosperous companies hire builders from nearby towns to construct sturdy fortresses, many of which are large enough for commonfolk to retreat to in times of emergency. Dufastan is ruled by a king, but the monarchy does not directly control most of the region. Instead, Dufastanian kings govern their own fiefdom and delegate rule of other areas to well-known or prosperous mercenary companies. Leaders of these companies act as minor nobles, enforcing (or not enforcing) the law in their controlled lands and pay yearly taxes to the king. ",

Elves in Estilia place high value on manners – long lives mean long memories, so perceived insults or slights may cause family feuds that last decades. Lineage is important to Estilian elves, and the most important political figures of each city state can trace their bloodline back for generations. Most Estilians desire political power for themselves and their descendants, laying the groundwork for long-term plans and reaping the benefits of plans laid by their ancestors (or paying the price for past plans gone awry). High elves in Estilia give great importance to the arts and the humanities. They respect the classical arts (painting, music, sculpture, etc) as well as philosophy, literature, and music. They have don’t have much respect for craftsman or merchants and a distaste for farming and labor work, considering their culture as having surpassed the need for those occupations. They import most of their food from Dufastan and Hallangar, as well as wine and other luxury items from Vitchar. In return for goods, Estilian elves perform magical services at a high price. Powerful and rich families from other realms hire lesser Estilian politicians to act as impartial judges in important disputes, as high elves are respected, especially in human kingdoms, for their intelligence and ability as politicians. Lastly, traders are required to pay city states for permission to trade in that city (which rich traders are willing to do, given that many magical or unique items can only be found in Estilian cities and fetch high prices elsewhere).

The noblest of the human-centric nations, Hallangar is a land with a history of chivalry, monarchy, and military achievement. Members of the aristocracy do not need much encouragement to begin recounting the heroic deeds of their ancestors that secured their family a permanent seat in Hallangar’s royal court. During the War of the Lakes in the First Era, Hallangar’s current monarchy rose to power. The most loyal supporters of the queen were rewarded with noble titles and the promise that those titles would be hereditary. The monarchy in Hallangar is matriarchal. In 794 S.E., when the reigning queen Thelia died, her eldest son Marnod attempted to secede with his lands in northeastern Hallangar. The eldest daughter Senelia, now queen, raised a temporary army in the west and hired a mercenary company from Dufastan to the east. Marnod, expecting a secure eastern border, was unable to fight a war on two fronts and the civil war was quickly ended. Although his secession didn’t have much support among the common people, there is a lot of resentment towards Dufastan among people in eastern Hallangar. Many Hallangarians think that Dufastan should not have been allowed to march into Hallangar, regardless of the fact that they were hired by the Queen Selenia. There are several prestigious knightly orders in Hallangar. The three main orders are: . | The Chronim Knights | The Order of Parthalis | The Fellowship of Tolar | . The established knightly orders are generally well-respected and most Hallangarians with a talent for the martial arts choose to join a knightly order. Prestigious orders are very difficult to join and only accept skilled fighters with the discipline to follow their knightly codes. ",

For centuries, they have fought to push back the goblins that occupy the southern end of the Kyrgann mountain range. They prize quality metalwork, especially weapons and armor crafting. All dwarf children are trained as warriors from a young age and required to serve on the frontlines. Rather than requiring a minimum number of years of service, dwarves must remain on the frontlines until they have killed a minimum number of goblins (the required number changes depending on the state of the war). Kursk is ruled by a queen who has supreme authority – her word is not questioned and she commands total respect. Kurskan dwarves are a matriarchal society, both in their government and family structure. Each established dwarven family is run by a matriarch, the most powerful of which often advise the queen or act as her officers. It is uncommon for male dwarves to hold any positions of power in the Kurskan army, as female dwarves are generally better warriors and shrewd commanders. Most crafters in Kursk focus on weapons, armor, or other martial products, but some spend their time crafting jewelry, ornate furniture, glasswork, elaborate stonework, or other fine goods. These crafters hold lower status in society and justify their pursuits by funding the war effort with profits from exporting their finished works to other regions. Some crafters even choose to leave Kursk completely and move to another region (usually Vitchar) where their craft is more respected. Unless they regularly send money back to Kursk to fund the war, they are considered “dvurkist”, which is most accurately translated as “warped-sword-traitor”, with the cultural context of swords being weapons for weaker races.

If a soul is pledged to a deity, the soul will be sent to whichever plane their deity is bound to. Souls that are not pledged to a deity are sent to the neutral plane, where they are overseen by a purely neutral deity who rarely chooses to get involved. A pledge can be formed between a soul and a deity only with consent from both parties, but once the pledge is formed, the deity has complete control over breaking the bond. If a deity moves between planes, all souls bound to that deity move with them, so politics between deities impact the souls bound to them. Deities have personalities and agency and they plot and politic amongst themselves. Deities can be forced from their plane to another plane if they are overpowered by the other deities on their plane, and they can force their way onto another plane if they are powerful enough, but this is very difficult and almost never happens. A deity has a base amount of power granted by their divine spark, but most of their power is based on how many followers they have and how devout those followers are. Deities are very invested in what is happening on the prime material plane because they want to increase their followers and decrease the followers of opposing deities. A deity can support a number of paladins and clerics based on their power level. Minor deities can only grant power to a few followers, and even the strongest deities can only empower a few hundred followers at most, so they want to choose carefully. Deities rely on their agents to use their power to protect their followers and increase their influence. ",

    "content": "Subterra is the realm of various caverns, tunnels, and deep spaces below the continent of Eryst. It is populated by a variety of species and races. Before the First Era, most regions of Subterra had not been explored and much of the realm was home to dangerous wild species and monsters. During the First Era, with the population of Eryst on the rise, many cultures with a natural affinity for being underground chose to expand their cities in the direction of Subterra. The largest cities now contain a range of surface communities, semi-underground communities, and fully Subterran communities. Smaller settlements were not as capable of the construction and mining required to expand their existing town, and many chose to abandon the surface in favor of a Subterran existence. Explorers, map-makers, and adventurers were at the frontlines of the initial expansion into Subterra. As underground regions were explored, outposts were constructed that grew into settlements and eventually towns and cities. And so the wild areas of Subterra were gradually tamed, with much of the natural flora being domesticated and adapted to support the underground communities; mushrooms in particular are a staple for nearly every Subterran. The relatively rapid expansion of communities into what was previously a dangerous realm has left its mark on many of the cultures. The organized and “good” cultures were most effective at working together to build lasting communities. By the Second Era, most chaotic or evil cultures in Subterra have only been able to remain on the fringes of the realm, having been steadily pushed back by the armies of the more respectable and law-abiding cultures. Most cultures in Subterra consider lawfulness and respect for one’s fellow beings to be of great importance. In the Second Era, most regions of Subterra are safe and civilized, with well-maintained roads and law-abiding citizenry. Trade in Subterra is regulated by most cities and often heavily taxed to pay for the upkeep of necessary infrastructure. Although Subterra is often the safest route for traders, trading routes on the surface can offer the potential for more profit for those willing to take the risks. ",

The Abyssal Realm is tied to fire, metal, and poison. Demons are always trying to encroach on the faerie and the faerie are always trying to push back the demons. The Faerie Realm is permeated with magic and completely overgrown with natural life. Homes and other buildings are grown and incorporated into fantastically large trees, mushrooms, cacti, or other plants. The realm has different laws of physics and magic works differently there. Actions that people from the material plane would consider unremarkable could represent agreement or a form of transaction and could create types of binding magical contracts. In the Faerie Realm, promises are inherently binding and there are repercussions for breaking them. There are two main humanoid races of the Faerie Realm: the Raynaerie and the Lunaerie. The Raynaerie are medium-sized humanoid creatures with large butterfly wings. They have hollow bones of a material different than normal bones. They have strong immune systems and a strong constitution regarding poison, disease, venom, and other bodily influences, but they are physically more fragile than a human or elf of the same size. Faerie culture is very different in terms of morality and law and the rules of society. It’s very hard for races from the material plane to understand the minds of faerie creatures. Some elements of faerie society might seem evil or cruel, but are natural and normal to the faerie. Actions that may seem courteous, polite, generous, or good hearted in the material plane may offend faerie creatures or seem evil or cruel to them. Magic permeates the Faerie Realm and the Abyssal Realm. Faerie creatures and abyssal creatures are inherently magical and resistant to some types of magic. Faerie creatures value age; they view it as an investment of energy and time into a creature. The old are venerated and the young are not valued. Life has no inherent meaning to them because the value of a life is dependent on the time and energy that’s been invested in it, so some lives might be worthless to the faerie but others may be priceless. The faerie place great value on time and memory, so sentimental value also has great meaning to faerie creatures. Nature has great meaning to the faerie. They value tangible items more if they were organically or naturally made, so the most value an item can have in this regard is if it was purely naturally occurring. An item that was grown intentionally, but with nature being guided to create the desired form is acceptable but not ideal. The least valuable type of item is something that was forced into the desired form. Consequently, metalworking, woodworking in a way where the wood is cut or sanded to shape, items made of glass, or items that are carved or forcefully manipulated have less value. The more force that was required to create a thing, the less valuable that thing is, regardless of (what humans would consider) the practical value of an item. ",

Morning sunlight filters through the fiery leaves of maple trees surrounding the small town, scattering deep orange light across the wood-shingled roofs of shops scattered along the edges of the main street. You recognize some standard local signage above shop doors: a butcher, a general goods shop, an apothecary, and a bank, among others. In the center of a roughly cobbled town square, two massive trees tower above nearby buildings. A few townspeople with early morning errands bustle up and down the road, with many more sitting outside and enjoying the brisk autumn air before starting their day in earnest. Off the main road, a variety of modest homes are organized into clusters of four to eight buildings, with small communal green spaces and gardens between them. Breakfast smoke rises from chimneys and children play outside before being called in for their morning meal. Down by the lake’s edge, a moderately sized set of docks extends some 50 feet into the deep waters. Small fishing boats bob close to shore, securely tied to the dock, watching over neat piles of fishing nets. At the end of the largest pier, a three-masted merchant vessel sits low in the water, likely loaded with goods from the city of Preldon, a trading hub at the eastern edge of the lake and near the border of Dufastan. This is the charming town of Twin Trees: a picturesque village nestled between the forest and the great lake, a quiet farming community, and a popular tourist destination. Some travelers visit to escape the noise of the city, to walk in the nearby woods, or to purchase fresh produce from the farms nearby, but most out-of-towners are here for something else entirely. Just outside of town, in a large venue specially constructed for the occasion, crowds gather to watch (and gamble on) the weekly corgal races. Originally bred from dogs to be a smart and energetic work animal, corgals are pony-sized corgis that have lost none of their ancestral temperament or personality. Fluffy, stubby, and surprisingly speedy, the local corgals provide an adorable spectacle that attracts families, curious travelers, and even a few degenerate gamblers. ",

Half-elves and humans live side-by-side in the port cities of Vitchar and control most of the wealth in the region. Wine drives both trade and politics - the wealthiest residents own large estates (usually vineyards) slightly inland in the low hills near the coast. The government is run by the Financial Regent, who is elected by the Merchant’s Guild once every 3 years. The mix of booming trade, lavish wealth, and constant political turmoil naturally attracts crime – indeed, the Thieves Guild has a strong presence in all Vitcharian cities. They provide “protection” for small businesses and hire out to anyone able to pay for their services. Wealthy families looking to secure the position of Financial Regent will often hire the Thieves Guild as election time approaches, using the varied skills of its members to make their political opponents appear weak and incapable of rule. Even the oldest, most established Vitcharian families are merchants at heart and value stability over all else - after all, stability means good trading for those already at the top. Wine is Vitchar’s major export, but their ports boast exotic goods from faraways lands as well as opulent gems and fine metalwork from the Dwarven kingdom of Kursk. Southern Vitcharian cities have a small but healthy market for the more common magical items from Estilia. Blood and wine flow freely on the streets of Vitchar, attracting evil beings with a delight for gluttony, debauchery, and revelry. ",

But the history books still remember the chaos of the First Era, when nearly all nations were involved in long, bloody conflicts that seemed to have no end. Eventually tired of centuries of war, or perhaps financially unable to sustain any more conflict, all nations of the continent convened a summit and laid down the treaty of Carbellis in which each government agreed to demilitarize in the interest of continental peace, marking the end of the era of war and beginning the era of peace. This has mostly worked for the last 900 years, with only a few minor wars between individual nations. Every border dispute and perceived diplomatic slight are moments when nations hold their breath, waiting for a conflict to spiral into another continental war. Although no nation technically has an army, most have large contingents of guards and the treaty does not forbid non-governmental entities from having soldiers or guards, or mercenary companies. ",
