    "content": "Racial Majority: Elven (Wood elves), pixies, sprites . Geography: Thick forest, mixed pine/deciduous . Covered in thick forest that has been cultivated for hundreds of years, Ardella is the stronghold of the wood elves of Eryst. The wood elves of Ardella act as sentinels and guardians of the forest, keeping the realm safe for the beasts and fey creatures that live there. Ardella is free of evil creatures, but home to many proud and fierce beasts that demand the respect of residents and travelers alike. Wood elves prefer to live in harmony with the forest, reflected in the natural construction of their towns and cities. Ardellan settlements are grown from the living wood, often shrouded in glamours and illusions that make them impossible for unwanted travelers to find. Ardella is ruled by a council of elders, druids and veteran rangers. Each group makes up one third of the council. The elders primarily represent the interests of the people, the druids speak for the well-being of the forest, and the rangers ensure the safety of the realm against outside forces (mainly Orcish raiding parties from Gantrik and human bandits from Fallona and Hallangar). The forests of Ardella are self-sufficient and mostly closed to outside travel, but halflings from Birschland are held in good standing due to their love of peace and farming. High elves from Estilia occasionally travel to Ardella to visit their woodland relatives, or stay there while on their way to Hvammsund. ",

    "content": "All souls of beings who die on the prime material plane (Eryst) are funneled into the celestial, neutral, or demonic planes depending on which god they worship. If a soul is pledged to a god, the soul will be sent to whichever plane their god is bound to. The pledge can be formed between a soul and a god only by consent from both parties, but once the pledge is formed, the god has complete control over breaking the bond. Souls that are not pledged to a god will be reborn on the prime material plane OR will be sent to the neutral plane, maybe there is a god who takes all souls that are not pledged. If a god moves between planes, all souls bound to that god move with them. So politics between gods impact the souls bound to them. Gods have personalities, agency, and they plot and politic amongst themselves. Gods can be forced from their plane to another plane if they are overpowered by the other gods on their plane. Or they can force their way onto another plane if they are powerful enough. A god has a certain amount of base power granted by a divine spark, but additional (most of) their power is based on how many followers they have and how devout they are. So gods are very invested in what is happening on the prime material plane because they want to increase their followers and decrease the followers of opposing gods. A god can support a number of paladins and clerics baser on their power level. Essentially they can grant power to one person per X number of followers (1000?). So they want to choose carefully who they grant power to, because theyâ€™re relying on that person to use the power to protect their followers and/or increase the influence of the religion. ",
