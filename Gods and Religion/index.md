All souls of beings who die on the prime material plane (Eryst) are funneled into the celestial, neutral, or infernal planes depending on which god they worship. If a soul is pledged to a god, the soul will be sent to whichever plane their god is bound to. The pledge can be formed between a soul and a god only by consent from both parties, but once the pledge is formed, the god has complete control over breaking the bond.

Souls that are not pledged to a god will be reborn on the prime material plane OR will be sent to the neutral plane, maybe there is a god who takes all souls that are not pledged.

If a god moves between planes, all souls bound to that god move with them. So politics between gods impact the souls bound to them. Gods have personalities, agency, and they plot and politic amongst themselves. Gods can be forced from their plane to another plane if they are overpowered by the other gods on their plane. Or they can force their way onto another plane if they are powerful enough.

A god has a certain amount of base power granted by a divine spark, but additional (most of) their power is based on how many followers they have and how devout they are. So gods are very invested in what is happening on the prime material plane because they want to increase their followers and decrease the followers of opposing gods. 

A god can support a number of paladins and clerics baser on their power level. Essentially they can grant power to one person per X number of followers (1000?). So they want to choose carefully who they grant power to, because they're relying on that person to use the power to protect their followers and/or increase the influence of the religion.
