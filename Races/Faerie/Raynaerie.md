The Raynaerie are medium-sized humanoid creatures with large butterfly wings. They have hollow bones of a light translucent crystal. They have strong immune systems and a strong constitution regarding poison, disease, venom, and other bodily influences, but they are physically more fragile than a human or elf of the same size.

They worship the sun.
