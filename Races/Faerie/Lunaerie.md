The Lunaerie are small-sized humanoid creatures with large moth wings. They have bones made of a wood-like material and bark-like skin. Different subraces of Lunaerie can be differentiated by their varying skin types, from rough pine bark to smooth willow bark to papery, shedding birch bark.

They worship the moon.
